## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores a rich dataset containing **55,500 patient records** from leading hospitals in the United States.

Using **Power BI**, I transformed raw medical data into interactive dashboards that reveal:

- Patient demographics
- Top medical conditions
- Medication usage
- Hospital load distribution
- Insurance coverage trends
- Doctor performance insights

## 🧠 Key Insights

- 👵 **Most patients are aged 55+**, often battling diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.
- 📍 **Houston** leads in patient admissions — one hospital alone served over **20,000 patients**.
- 🩸 **Blood group A+** is common among those with chronic illnesses.
- 💊 **Paracetamol & Penicillin** are widely prescribed, raising questions about symptom vs. cause treatment.
- 📈 **2020 had the highest hospital admissions**, reflecting the impact of COVID-19.
- 🧑‍⚕️ **Medicare** supports over 50% of all recorded patients.
